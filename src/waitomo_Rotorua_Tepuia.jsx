              <p>  <span className='fw-bold'> 3. Pirongia  – </span> We take a little break for coffee in a quaint village after exploring the area's history, which includes the New Zealand Land Wars and driving through picturesque scenery.</p>
              <p>  <span className='fw-bold'> 4. Otorohanga–  </span> We travel on and arrive in Otorohanga, sometimes referred to as the "Kiwiana Capital of New Zealand."
